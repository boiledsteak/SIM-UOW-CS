Case Study: Cross-Cultural Management Challenges 
Peter Wilson in Indonesia

 


Introduction

Globalisation has enabled organisations to expand across borders, requiring managers to adapt to diverse cultural contexts. This case study examines the experience of Peter Wilson, an Australian Sales Manager, who was assigned to his company’s subsidiary in Indonesia. 


Case Description

Peter Wilson had built a strong reputation as a Sales Manager in Australia, where his approach to leadership emphasised teamwork, structured planning, and direct communication. When offered the opportunity to take up a managerial role in his company’s subsidiary in Indonesia, he viewed it as both a professional challenge and an opportunity to broaden his international experience. Confident in his leadership style, Wilson anticipated that his collaborative, problem-solving approach would be well received by his new colleagues.

 

Upon arrival, Wilson arranged an introductory meeting with the local management team. He intended to quickly establish rapport while simultaneously setting the groundwork for developing a revised sales strategy. After exchanging greetings, Wilson attempted to move the group into business discussions. He emphasised the urgency of the subsidiary’s current sales challenges and outlined his agenda, hoping to create a clear direction from the outset.

 

However, the Indonesian managers did not immediately align with his structured approach. They appeared more inclined to engage in casual conversation and interpersonal exchanges before addressing formal business matters. Wilson found it difficult to redirect attention, as side conversations among the managers continued. It took several attempts before the group collectively focused on his proposed agenda.

 

As the discussion progressed, Wilson relied on his usual communication style: explicit, problem-focused, and outcome-driven. He highlighted weaknesses in the subsidiary’s sales performance and asked for direct input from the managers. During this process, Wilson noticed three of the local managers whispering among themselves in disagreement with another manager who occasionally contributed to the conversation. Over time, this manager became increasingly quiet and eventually stopped participating altogether. Wilson chose not to address the tension, remaining focused on working through the list of agenda items. His goal was to leave the meeting with a concrete plan of action.

 

When the scheduled time drew to a close, Wilson felt little progress had been made toward his objectives. To his surprise, the managers seemed more enthusiastic about staying behind to converse with him, though their interest centred on personal and social matters rather than sales-related issues. Wilson was polite but left the meeting uncertain about how to move forward with his strategy.

 

In the days that followed, Wilson continued to experience workplace practices that contrasted sharply with his expectations. On Fridays, employees left the office around noon to attend Jumu’ah (midday prayers). Work briefly resumed afterwards, only to be interrupted again by lunch breaks. From Wilson’s perspective, these interruptions fragmented the workday, making it difficult to sustain momentum on projects. He also observed a more fluid and less predictable office rhythm. Tasks seemed to progress slowly, with approvals and decisions often requiring multiple steps or informal discussions. Spontaneous interactions frequently reshaped the flow of the day, leaving Wilson frustrated by what he perceived as inefficiency and a lack of urgency.



At the same time, Wilson became increasingly aware that his local colleagues placed high importance on interpersonal relationships and trust-building. Business discussions are often intertwined with social conversations, and managers seem more comfortable engaging informally before committing to structured plans. While Wilson initially viewed these interactions as distractions from the “real work,” he gradually realised that they were, in fact, central to how collaboration developed within the Indonesian subsidiary.

 

Despite his frustrations, Wilson remained committed to finding a way forward. He recognised that his task-oriented, efficiency-driven management style might not translate seamlessly in this new environment. As he reflected on the challenges, Wilson began to question how he could adapt his leadership and sales strategy to be more effective in the Indonesian cultural context.












Question One
Using Edward Hall’s Context Model, analyse Peter Wilson’s experience in Indonesia and identify the cultural issues that are present in this scenario. How did you determine these issues? Support your discussion with at least four pieces of evidence from the case study.

kinda wrong. achievement oriented is 6 dimensions not context framework
	Peter wanted to be more work oriented while his indonesian team members were more relationship focused.
	"They appeared more inclined to engage in casual conversation and interpersonal exchanges before addressing formal business matters". Peter wanted to talk about work but his indonesian team members wanted to talk cock with him. This displays a cultural conflict because peter is exhibiting low context behaviour of being achievement focused while the indo team was exhibiting high context behaviour of being relationship focused

Peter wanted to have explicit communication with his team but his team was exhibiting ambiguous communication
"Wilson noticed three of the local managers whispering among themselves in disagreement with another manager"
this whispering among themselves shows ambiguous communication.
"Peter Wilson had built a strong reputation as a Sales Manager in Australia, where his approach to leadership emphasised teamwork, structured planning, and direct communication"
direct communication shows that peter performed explicit communication 

This displays a cultural conflict because peter is exhibiting low context behaviour of speaking explicitly while his team was exhibiting high context behaviour of being ambiguous, implicit communication


peter wanted more rigid timelines while his team wanted more flexible timeline
"He also observed a more fluid and less predictable office rhythm"
this shows that the team mates were okay having fragmented timelines, more flexible.
"From Wilson’s perspective, these interruptions fragmented the workday, making it difficult to sustain momentum on projects."
this shows that wilson wanted sequential rigid timeline
This displays a cultural conflict because peter is exhibiting low context behaviour of preferring rigid timelines while his team mates exhibit high context behaviour of having flexible timeline








Question Two
Analyse Peter Wilson’s style of managing conflict in this situation. Support your discussion with at least four pieces of evidence from the case study. Based on your analysis, suggest how Wilson might have improved his approach to handling conflict in this intercultural setting.
